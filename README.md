I've added three files to the root of this folder to highlight them:

* AncientRuins.lua - the main lua file for my [Ancient Ruins Expanded mod for Civilization V](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=431922378
)

* kittys_calculations.cpp - My 100% passing, original solution to one of the most difficult [challenges on HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/kittys-calculations-on-a-tree/problem
). Only 7% of the 750 people who have submitted a solution have fully passed, so I'm fairly proud of this one

* samples.cpp - A simple example of OOP best practices in C++. Provided mostly just to fill a gap not shown in my other samples


Also contains the following folders:

* CivilizationV - Contains the mods I've [published](http://steamcommunity.com/id/monju125/myworkshopfiles/?appid=8930) under my own username for Civ V. These are in Aeon Gamespeed, Ancient Ruins Expanded, and Total War. Also contains work I've contributed to other people's mods in the Decisions folder

* HackerRank/c++ - A selection of the higher difficulty HackerRank challenges I've completed in C++

* HTN - The current work in progress version of my hierarchical task network. Presently exists without documentation, which it desperately requires, but I will be rewriting it shortly to upgrade it to C++17 and move the plan functions into Lua instead of requiring them to be defined at compile time, so documentation is on the backburner. It's mostly for my own usage at the moment anyway, but is provided largely to show that I'm not a liar and have actually written my own hierarchical task network
