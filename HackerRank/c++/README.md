I think it's important to note that I use single line if and for statements without curly braces throughout these files and I'm on the fence about whether or not that's acceptable. I would like to think that I, the programmer, am capable of keeping track of when I've used them and will always alter them correctly as necessary, but I'm open to the possibility that it's bad practice no matter what. I know Apple had a bug in their TLS a few years ago that boiled down to a malformed single line if statement, and that makes me nervous about my own code.
